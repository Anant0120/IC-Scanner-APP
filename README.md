# IC SCANNER APP

Developed an innovative Integrated Circuit (IC) Scanner mobile application using Flutter and Optical Character 
Recognition (OCR) technology. The app allows users to scan ICs using their smartphone camera and provides 
relevant information and datasheets for the scanned ICs. By leveraging OCR techniques, the app extracts text from 
the scanned IC and retrieves detailed specifications, pin diagrams, and datasheets from an extensive IC database. 
This project combines the power of Flutter's cross-platform development capabilities with OCR technology to enhance 
accessibility and convenience in the field of IC identification and analysis.
